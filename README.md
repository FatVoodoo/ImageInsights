# ImageInsights

A simple search engine that returns images based on HEX color code. A flask based Web-based application to upload and view files. It also tells dominant colors based on pixels. 

A very early stage and immature search engine at the moment as it does not cater to color segmentation etc.

The blog post about this work is given [here](http://blog.adnansiddiqi.me/create-a-simplest-image-search-engine-in-opencv-and-flask/).
